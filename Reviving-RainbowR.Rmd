# Our mission is to *support*, *promote* and *connect* LGBTQ+ people in the R community and to *spread awareness* of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven activism.

---

## LGBTQ+ people

--

-   those who identify as being a minority sexual orientation, i.e. those who are not straight/heterosexual

-   those who are not cisgender, i.e. those whose sense of personal identity and gender does not correspond with their birth sex

--

## These are RainbowRs!

--

To our straight, cis friends: we very much appreciate your allyship and your support of RainbowR, e.g. by sharing our information and posts on social media and by telling your friends and colleagues about us.
